**NB** Because R Studio is not the default environment in Binder once your environment has been created you will need to substitute the /lab part of the web address with /rstudio.

If you want to download a copy of the notebook we are going to work on you need to follow these steps. 
- Go back to the Jupyter interface by subsituting /rstudio with /lab
- Navigate to the file you want to download
